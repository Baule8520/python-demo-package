This is a simple example package I built to learn how Python Packages work.

The package contains a "Hello" Function and some Math Operations.

See the test.py file. --> "python test.py"

To install the package via pip: pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ example-pkg-baule8520

To create uploadable dist file: "python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel"
